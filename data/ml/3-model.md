Here's a progressive list of ML models from simplest to most complex, categorized by conceptual/intuitive complexity and implementation difficulty:

- **Perceptron (Rosenblatt, 1957)**:  
  - *Concept*: Learns weights via error correction. Still binary output, step activation.  
  - *Limitation*: Only linearly separable problems (fails on XOR).

### **2. Classical Statistical Models**
- **Linear Regression**:  
  - *Concept*: Models linear relationships. Continuous output. Closed-form solution (OLS) or gradient descent.  
- **Logistic Regression**:  
  - *Concept*: Binary classification via sigmoid activation. Outputs probabilities. Foundation for deeper models.  
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**:  
  - *Concept*: Finds optimal hyperplane using kernels (linear, polynomial, RBF) for non-linear data.  

### **3. Tree-Based & Ensemble Models**
- **Decision Trees**:  
  - *Concept*: Human-interpretable, splits data using rules (entropy/Gini impurity).  
- **Random Forest**:  
  - *Concept*: Ensemble of decorrelated decision trees (bagging). Reduces overfitting.  
- **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM/XGBoost/LightGBM)**:  
  - *Concept*: Sequentially corrects errors of prior trees (boosting). State-of-the-art for tabular data.  

### **4. Neural Network Fundamentals**
- **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) / Feedforward Neural Network (FNN)**:  
  - *Concept*: Input â†’ Hidden layers â†’ Output. Learns non-linear mappings via backpropagation.  
  - *Activation*: Sigmoid/tanh (historical), ReLU (modern).  
  - *Use Case*: Tabular data, simple patterns.  
- **Deep Neural Network (DNN)**:  
  - *Concept*: MLP with many hidden layers. Enables hierarchical feature learning.  

### **5. Specialized Architectures**
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**:  
  - *Concept*: Processes grid-like data (images) via convolution â†’ pooling â†’ FC layers.  
  - **LeNet-5 (1998)**: First successful CNN (digits recognition).  
  - **AlexNet (2012)**: Revolutionized deep learning (ImageNet win). Used ReLU/dropout/GPU training.  
  - *Variants*: VGG, ResNet (skip connections), Inception.  
- **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)**:  
  - *Concept*: Handles sequences (time-series/text). Hidden state retains memory.  
  - *Limitations*: Vanishing gradients, short-term memory.  
  - **LSTM/GRU**: Gated RNN variants for long-term dependencies.  

### **6. Advanced Architectures**
- **Transformers**:  
  - *Concept*: Self-attention mechanism (no recurrence). Parallelizable, excels in NLP.  
  - *Examples*: BERT, GPT.  
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)**:  
  - *Concept*: Generator vs. discriminator compete (e.g., creates realistic images).  
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)**:  
  - *Concept*: Operates on graph-structured data (social networks, molecules).
