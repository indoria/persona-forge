### **III. Testing & Validation**

**1. Adversarial Testing Strategy**
Defines how the AI system is tested against adversarial inputs or edge cases to ensure robustness and reliability.

**2. Fairness and Bias Evaluation Report**
Details the demographic parity, equalized odds, disparate impact assessments, etc., and the mitigation strategies applied if needed.

**3. Regression Test Suite**
Ensures new versions of AI models do not introduce performance regressions, especially critical in iterative model improvement.

---

### **IV. Deployment & Operations**

**1. CI/CD Pipeline Documentation (MLOps)**
Describes the automated workflow for building, testing, validating, and deploying models using tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or Kubeflow.

**2. Data Drift & Concept Drift Monitoring Strategy**
Outlines techniques (e.g., population stability index, KL divergence) to detect when incoming data or real-world conditions diverge from training data.

**3. Model Governance & Audit Trail**
Includes logs of who trained which model, on what data, when, using what hyperparameters â€” essential for regulated industries.

---

### **V. Post-Deployment & Ongoing Management**

**1. Continuous Learning Policy**
Specifies whether and how the model learns from new data in production (online learning, human-in-the-loop feedback loops).

**2. Feedback Loop Documentation**
Describes how user feedback is collected, stored, and incorporated back into the model training or product improvement process.

**3. Compliance Audit Logs**
Logs maintained for external/internal audits to prove responsible AI practices â€” includes access logs, model changes, data access, consent handling, etc.

**4. End-of-Life Data Retention & Disposal Policy**
Guidelines for how long data is retained, anonymized, or purged in alignment with data privacy regulations.
