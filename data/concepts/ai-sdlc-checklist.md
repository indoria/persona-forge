### ‚úÖ Tip: How to Use This in Git

* Save as `docs/documentation-checklist.md`.
* Create a `README.md` linking to each document when it exists.
* Use checkboxes (`- [x]`) if you want an interactive Markdown experience.
* Add each document to source control with version tags (e.g., `docs/ai_model_design_v1.0.md`).

Would you like a **spreadsheet version** or a **Markdown template** to get started directly?
