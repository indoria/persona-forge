**Example Code**
---------------

Here's an example code snippet in Python to illustrate the implementation of the Pitch Analyzer module:
```python
import nltk
from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

class PitchAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, pitch_text, persona_data):
        self.pitch_text = pitch_text
        self.persona_data = persona_data

    def parse_pitch(self):
        # Parse the pitch text into its constituent parts
        subject_line = self.pitch_text["subject_line"]
        introduction = self.pitch_text["introduction"]
        body = self.pitch_text["body"]
        conclusion = self.pitch_text["conclusion"]
        return subject_line, introduction, body, conclusion

    def extract_keywords(self):
        # Extract keywords from the pitch text
        vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
        tfidf = vectorizer.fit_transform([self.pitch_text])
        keywords = vectorizer.get_feature_names_out()
        return keywords

    def analyze_sentiment(self):
        # Analyze the sentiment of the pitch text
        sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
        sentiment_score = sia.polarity_scores(self.pitch_text)
        return sentiment_score

    def evaluate_clarity(self):
        # Evaluate the clarity of the pitch text
        readability_score = nltk.FleschKincaidGradeLevel(self.pitch_text)
        return readability_score

    def evaluate_persona_based_relevance(self):
        # Evaluate the relevance of the pitch text to the target persona
        persona_vector = self.persona_data["vector"]
        pitch_vector = self.pitch_text["vector"]
        similarity_score = cosine_similarity(persona_vector, pitch_vector)
        return similarity_score

    def calculate_pitch_score(self):
        # Calculate the pitch score based on the evaluation criteria
        pitch_score = 0.5 * self.analyze_sentiment() + 0.3 * self.evaluate_clarity() + 0.2 * self.evaluate_persona_based_relevance()
        return pitch_score

    def generate_recommendations(self):
        # Generate recommendations based on the pitch score and evaluation criteria
        if self.calculate_pitch_score() > 0.7:
            return "Recommendation 1: Revise the pitch to improve clarity and relevance."
        else:
            return "Recommendation 2: Revise the pitch to improve sentiment and tone."

# Example usage
pitch_text = {"subject_line": "Sample Pitch", "introduction": "Introduction to the pitch.", "body": "Body of the pitch.", "conclusion": "Conclusion of the pitch."}
persona_data = {"vector": [1, 2, 3]}
pitch_analyzer = PitchAnalyzer(pitch_text, persona_data)
print(pitch_analyzer.generate_recommendations())
```
Note that this is a simplified example and actual implementation may vary based on specific requirements and complexity of the Pitch Analyzer module.

In this example, the Pitch Analyzer module sends a GET request to the Persona Management module's API to retrieve the persona data for the specified persona ID. The Persona Management module returns the persona data in JSON format, which is then used by the Pitch Analyzer module for pitch analysis.


Note that this is a highly simplified example and actual implementation may vary based on specific requirements and complexity of the pitch analysis module.
