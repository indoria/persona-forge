        * "Prompt Engineering for Developers" or similar courses offer structured learning.
* **Practice Exercise:**
    1.  Define a simple persona (e.g., "a grumpy but helpful librarian" or "an enthusiastic tech evangelist").
    2.  Using system messages and prompt design techniques, try to make your LLM API calls (from Module 1) consistently respond in that persona.
    3.  Experiment with asking the persona to provide output in specific formats (e.g., a bulleted list, a short paragraph, JSON).

#### **Module 3: Embedding Text and Building a Vector Knowledge Base (RAG Part 1)**

* **Objective:** Understand text embeddings, learn how to generate them using different models/APIs, and set up a local vector database.
* **Crucial Skill:** Vector Embeddings & Vector Databases.

    * **Hugging Face `sentence-transformers`** (Free; requires local compute)
        * Focus on loading pre-trained models and generating embeddings for sentences/documents.
        * **Learning Resource:** [Sentence-Transformers Documentation](https://www.sbert.net/index.html)
        * **Learning Resource:** [How to choose a Sentence Transformer from Hugging Face | Weaviate Blog](https://weaviate.io/blog/how-to-choose-a-sentence-transformer-from-hugging-face)
    * **OpenAI API (Embeddings endpoint)** (Free credits for new users, then pay-as-you-go)
        * **Learning Resource:** [Web Q&A - OpenAI API (Embeddings Tutorial)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/tutorials/web-qa-embeddings)
    * **Google Gemini API (Embeddings endpoint)** (Free tier/credits through Google Cloud, then pay-as-you-go)
        * **Learning Resource:** [Get text embeddings | Generative AI on Vertex AI - Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-text-embeddings)
    * **ChromaDB** (Free, open-source; runs locally)
        * Focus on basic installation, creating collections, adding documents with embeddings, and performing similarity searches.
        * **Learning Resource:** [ChromaDB Documentation](https://docs.trychroma.com/)
* **Practice Exercise:**
    1.  Take a small set of text documents (e.g., 3-5 paragraphs about a specific topic, acting as your persona's "knowledge base").
    2.  Generate embeddings for each paragraph using `sentence-transformers` (or OpenAI/Gemini API).
    3.  Load these text chunks and their embeddings into a ChromaDB collection.
    4.  Perform a simple semantic search: embed a query, then retrieve the most similar text chunk from ChromaDB.

#### **Module 4: Orchestrating Persona Intelligence with LLM Frameworks (RAG Part 2)**

* **Objective:** Learn how to use LangChain or LlamaIndex to build a basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, integrating LLMs, embeddings, and vector databases.

    2.  The RAG pipeline should:
        * Take a user query.
        * Embed the query.
        * Retrieve relevant text chunks from ChromaDB.
        * Pass the retrieved chunks (as context) and the original query to an LLM (from Module 1).
        * Generate a context-aware response.
    3.  Test your RAG system with questions that require knowledge from your uploaded documents.

    4.  Use `curl` or a simple Python `requests` call to test your local API.
