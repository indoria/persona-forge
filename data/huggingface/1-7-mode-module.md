Here is a high-level design for the "Mode Module":

**Overview**

The "Mode Module" is a critical component of the conversational AI system, responsible for managing the conversation mode and adapting the response based on the user's input and context. The module takes into account various factors, including the user's intent, sentiment, and emotional state, to determine the most suitable conversation mode.

**Components**

1. **Mode Manager**: This component is responsible for managing the conversation mode and adapting the response based on the user's input and context.
2. **Intent Detector**: This component is responsible for detecting the user's intent and sentiment, and providing input to the Mode Manager.
3. **Context Analyzer**: This component is responsible for analyzing the conversation context and providing input to the Mode Manager.
4. **Response Generator**: This component is responsible for generating the response based on the conversation mode and user input.

**Interface**

The "Mode Module" interface includes the following methods:

1. **`set_mode(mode)`**: Sets the conversation mode to the specified value (e.g. "customer support", "sales", etc.).
2. **`get_mode()`**: Returns the current conversation mode.
3. **`update_context(context)`**: Updates the conversation context with the provided information.
4. **`get_response(user_input)`**: Returns the response based on the user's input and conversation mode.
5. **`detect_intent(user_input)`**: Detects the user's intent and sentiment, and returns the result.

**Mode Types**

The "Mode Module" supports the following mode types:

1. **`customer_support`**: Provides support and answers questions related to a product or service.
2. **`sales`**: Provides information and promotes a product or service.
3. **`technical_support`**: Provides technical support and troubleshooting for a product or service.
4. **`general_conversation`**: Engages in general conversation and provides information on a wide range of topics.

**Context**

The "Mode Module" uses the following context information to adapt the response:

1. **`user_input`**: The user's input, including text, speech, or other forms of input.
2. **`conversation_history`**: The conversation history, including previous user inputs and responses.
3. **`user_preferences`**: The user's preferences, including language, tone, and format.

**Response**

The "Mode Module" generates responses based on the conversation mode and user input. The response may include:

1. **`text`**: A text-based response, including answers, explanations, and promotions.
2. **`image`**: An image-based response, including product images, diagrams, and charts.
3. **`video`**: A video-based response, including product demos, tutorials, and explanations.

**Error Handling**

The "Mode Module" includes error handling mechanisms to handle unexpected user input, conversation mode changes, and other errors. The module may return an error message or adapt the response to handle the error.

**Security**

The "Mode Module" includes security mechanisms to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access. The module may use encryption, authentication, and access control to ensure the security of user data.

Here is an example of how the "Mode Module" interface might be implemented in Python:
```python
class ModeModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.mode = None
        self.context = {}

    def set_mode(self, mode):
        self.mode = mode

    def get_mode(self):
        return self.mode

    def update_context(self, context):
        self.context.update(context)

    def get_response(self, user_input):
        # Generate response based on conversation mode and user input
        if self.mode == "customer_support":
            # Provide support and answer questions
            response = "Thank you for contacting our support team. How can we assist you today?"
        elif self.mode == "sales":
            # Provide information and promote a product or service
            response = "Our product is a great solution for your needs. Would you like to learn more?"
        #...
        return response

    def detect_intent(self, user_input):
        # Detect user intent and sentiment
        intent = "unknown"
        sentiment = "neutral"
        #...
        return intent, sentiment
```
Note that this is just one possible implementation of the "Mode Module" interface, and the actual implementation may vary depending on the specific requirements of the project.


# Detailed guide
Here is a step-by-step guide to implementing the Mode Module with modes like "interviewer", "critic", "educator", etc.:

**Step 1: Define the Modes**

* Define the different modes that the Mode Module will support, such as:
	+ "interviewer": asks questions and gathers information
	+ "critic": provides feedback and criticism
	+ "educator": provides information and teaches
	+ "mentor": provides guidance and support
	+ "facilitator": facilitates discussion and collaboration
* Determine the characteristics and behaviors of each mode, such as:
	+ Tone: formal, informal, friendly, critical, etc.
	+ Language: technical, non-technical, simple, complex, etc.
	+ Response style: direct, indirect, suggestive, prescriptive, etc.

**Step 2: Design the Mode Manager**

* Design a Mode Manager that can manage the different modes and switch between them based on user input or context
* Determine the inputs and outputs of the Mode Manager, such as:
	+ User input: text, speech, gestures, etc.
	+ Context: conversation history, user preferences, etc.
	+ Mode: current mode, previous mode, etc.
* Decide on the algorithms and data structures to use for the Mode Manager, such as:
	+ Finite state machine
	+ Decision tree
	+ Rule-based system

**Step 3: Implement the Mode Manager**

* Implement the Mode Manager using a programming language, such as Python or Java
* Use a library or framework to implement the Mode Manager, such as:
	+ NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
	+ spaCy
	+ scikit-learn
* Write code to handle the different modes and switch between them based on user input or context
* Test and debug the Mode Manager to ensure it works correctly

**Step 4: Define the Mode-Specific Responses**

* Define the responses for each mode, such as:
	+ "interviewer": asks questions and gathers information
	+ "critic": provides feedback and criticism
	+ "educator": provides information and teaches
	+ "mentor": provides guidance and support
	+ "facilitator": facilitates discussion and collaboration
* Determine the tone, language, and response style for each mode
* Write code to generate the responses for each mode

**Step 5: Integrate the Mode Module with the Conversation Module**

* Integrate the Mode Module with the Conversation Module to enable the conversation to switch between modes
* Use APIs or interfaces to communicate between the Mode Module and the Conversation Module
* Test and debug the integration to ensure it works correctly

**Step 6: Test and Refine the Mode Module**

* Test the Mode Module with different user inputs and contexts to ensure it works correctly
* Refine the Mode Module based on user feedback and testing results
* Continuously update and improve the Mode Module to ensure it meets the requirements and expectations of the users

Here is some sample code in Python to implement the Mode Module:
```python
import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

class ModeModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.modes = {
            "interviewer": self.interviewer_mode,
            "critic": self.critic_mode,
            "educator": self.educator_mode,
            "mentor": self.mentor_mode,
            "facilitator": self.facilitator_mode
        }
        self.current_mode = None

    def set_mode(self, mode):
        self.current_mode = mode

    def get_mode(self):
        return self.current_mode

    def interviewer_mode(self, user_input):
        # Ask questions and gather information
        tokens = word_tokenize(user_input)
        #...
        return "What is your name?"

    def critic_mode(self, user_input):
        # Provide feedback and criticism
        tokens = word_tokenize(user_input)
        #...
        return "Your answer is incorrect. Try again."

    def educator_mode(self, user_input):
        # Provide information and teach
        tokens = word_tokenize(user_input)
        #...
        return "The capital of France is Paris."

    def mentor_mode(self, user_input):
        # Provide guidance and support
        tokens = word_tokenize(user_input)
        #...
        return "You are doing great. Keep it up."

    def facilitator_mode(self, user_input):
        # Facilitate discussion and collaboration
        tokens = word_tokenize(user_input)
        #...
        return "Let's discuss this topic further."

# Create an instance of the ModeModule
mode_module = ModeModule()

# Set the mode to "interviewer"
mode_module.set_mode("interviewer")

# Get the response for the "interviewer" mode
response = mode_module.modes["interviewer"]("Hello")
print(response)  # Output: What is your name?
```
Note that this is just a simple example and the actual implementation may vary depending on the specific requirements and complexity of the project.
