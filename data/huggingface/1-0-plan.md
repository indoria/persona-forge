This Mermaid file provides an exhaustive list of all of the methods and properties exposed by all of the modules of the system. It includes the following modules:

* UserInterface: Handles user input and displays the response to the user.
* ConversationEngine: Processes user input and generates a response.
* NaturalLanguageProcessing: Analyzes text and extracts relevant information.
* Persona: Provides a response based on the persona's context and mode.
* Mode: Determines the current mode and updates the mode context.
* MoodInfluencer: Determines the current mood and updates the mood context.
* KnowledgeBase: Provides knowledge from the knowledge base and updates the knowledge base.
* DataStorage: Stores and retrieves data from the data storage.
* Analytics: Analyzes data and generates a report.

Each module has a set of methods and properties that are exposed to other modules. The relationships between the modules are also shown in the Mermaid file.


Here is another Mermaid file that demonstrates a use case where a user inputs a prompt and gets a response:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as "User"
    participant UI as "User Interface (UI) Module"
    participant CE as "Conversation Engine Module"
    participant NLP as "Natural Language Processing (NLP) Module"
    participant Persona as "Persona Module"
    participant Mode as "Mode Module"
    participant MI as "Mood Influencer Module"
    participant KB as "Knowledge Base Module"

    Note over User,UI: User inputs prompt "What is the weather like today?"
    User->>UI: Input prompt
    UI->>CE: Forward prompt to Conversation Engine
    CE->>NLP: Request NLP analysis of prompt
    NLP->>CE: Return NLP analysis results (intent: "weather", entities: ["today"])
    CE->>Mode: Determine mode based on NLP analysis results
    Mode->>CE: Return mode ("informative")
    CE->>MI: Determine mood influencer based on mode
    MI->>CE: Return mood influencer ("neutral")
    CE->>KB: Request knowledge base information based on NLP analysis results
    KB->>CE: Return knowledge base information ("weather forecast for today: sunny")
    CE->>Persona: Request persona response based on knowledge base information and mood influencer
    Persona->>CE: Return persona response ("Today's weather forecast is sunny.")
    CE->>UI: Return response to User Interface
    UI->>User: Display response to user

    Note over UI,User: User sees response "Today's weather forecast is sunny."
```
This Mermaid file demonstrates how the user's prompt gets modified by different modules as it flows through the system. The prompt is first input by the user and forwarded to the Conversation Engine. The Conversation Engine then requests NLP analysis of the prompt, which returns the intent and entities of the prompt. The Conversation Engine then determines the mode based on the NLP analysis results and determines the mood influencer based on the mode. The Conversation Engine then requests knowledge base information based on the NLP analysis results and returns the response to the User Interface, which displays the response to the user.

The prompt gets modified by the following modules:

* NLP Module: The NLP module analyzes the prompt and returns the intent and entities of the prompt.
* Mode Module: The Mode module determines the mode based on the NLP analysis results.
* Mood Influencer Module: The Mood Influencer module determines the mood influencer based on the mode.
* Knowledge Base Module: The Knowledge Base module returns knowledge base information based on the NLP analysis results.
* Persona Module: The Persona module returns a persona response based on the knowledge base information and mood influencer.

The final response to the user is "Today's weather forecast is sunny.", which is a combination of the knowledge base information and the persona response.
