## Arch

1. Pitch (text provided by user)

2. Summarizer (with elements from persona => Lens through which the pitch would be seen, interests, aversions etc.)
- NLP [How computer sees the semantics of text]
- Bias introduction by interests, aversions, triggers [How persona would see it]

3. Reasoning (What questions to ask, grade the pitch on defined parameters) few generic but mostly persona
- Generic grading parameters
- Persona specific parameters (e.g. weight of interests)

4. Knowledge base (extract relevant info with sections) {OR Knowledge Graph someday?}

5. LLM (stitch a response) with tone elements from persona

6. Response generator (formulate formal response in provided format)

7. Response
