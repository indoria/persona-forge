Great! I’ll create a detailed architecture and step-by-step implementation plan for a web-based AI persona app that replicates real and fictional journalists. It will support persistent user accounts, real-time and asynchronous modes, and include a config panel for modifying AI persona behavior. I’ll also provide both high-level and low-level architecture diagrams using Mermaid syntax.

I’ll let you know as soon as it’s ready.


# Web-Based AI Persona App Architecture and Implementation Guide

This guide outlines a detailed design for a web app where users submit text reports and receive responses from AI personas (e.g. real journalists or fictional characters). The core system is text-based (video output added later) and provides configurable persona settings (tone, interests, opinions). The technology stack uses a Python backend (e.g. Flask or FastAPI) and a vanilla JavaScript frontend. Users have accounts and can view past report–response discussions on their dashboard. Two modes are supported: **Real-time** (synchronous chat) and **Queued (asynchronous)** processing.

&#x20;*High-level architecture.* In this design the user’s browser (front end) communicates with a Python backend service. The backend then calls the AI model service (e.g. via OpenAI’s API or a local LLM) and stores data in a database. An example microservice setup is shown above, with separate services for the language-model API, the database (and its access API), and the user interface. In practice, an Nginx reverse-proxy or load balancer can sit in front of these services for routing and security. This separation into components (AI inference, database, UI) allows scalability and maintainability.

## Core Components

* **Frontend (Vanilla JavaScript):** The browser-based UI (HTML/CSS/JS) handles user interactions: login/signup, persona selection, report submission, and displaying AI responses. It communicates with the backend via RESTful API calls (e.g. using `fetch` or AJAX) over HTTPS. The frontend also provides a persona **Settings panel** where the user can adjust traits (tone, bias, interests) for the selected journalist. For example, the user might select “Formal” vs “Conversational” tone or emphasize certain topics. These settings are sent to the backend and ultimately influence the AI’s system prompt.
* **Backend (Python API):** A Python web server (e.g. Flask or FastAPI) implements the business logic. It handles user authentication (sessions or JWT), and exposes endpoints for actions like creating a new chat, fetching past chats, updating persona settings, etc. Upon receiving a report, the backend composes a prompt (including the persona configuration) and calls the AI model service. It then receives the AI-generated answer and returns it to the frontend (or queues it for later). The backend also reads/writes data to the database for persistence.
* **Database:** A database stores all persistent data: user accounts, persona profiles, conversation logs, and any queued tasks. You can use a relational DB (PostgreSQL/MySQL) or a document store. Typical schema: a `users` table (id, credentials), `personas` table (persona\_id, name, description, default style), `chats` table (chat\_id, user\_id, persona\_id, mode, timestamps), and a `messages` table (message\_id, chat\_id, sender, text, timestamp). Another table/collection can track queued jobs (job\_id, chat\_id, status, result). Each user’s dashboard pulls from this data. In practice, one approach is to save each conversation as one document (containing all messages); alternatively, store one row per message. The example IBM architecture used a document DB so that “conversation interactions” can persist in a single document.
* **AI Model Service:** The core AI engine (e.g. OpenAI’s GPT, Anthropic Claude, or a self-hosted LLM) generates the persona’s response. The backend sends the user’s report plus persona instructions. To emulate a journalist’s style, the request includes a **system prompt** such as:

  > *“You are **\[Journalist Name]**, a veteran journalist writing for a major news outlet. Answer the user’s report as this journalist would. Use a \[tone] style and emphasize topics like \[interests], reflecting the journalist’s known viewpoints \[opinions].”*

  This system message guides the model’s persona. The user’s text is then passed as the user message. The AI model returns the response text, which the backend forwards to the user. The persona settings (tone, focus, opinions) from the config panel are inserted into this prompt string.
* **Asynchronous Queue:** For queued-mode processing, use a task queue system (e.g. **Celery** with Redis or RabbitMQ). When a report is submitted in “Queued” mode, the backend enqueues a task (saving a job record in the DB) instead of calling the AI directly. A worker process picks up the task, calls the AI model, saves the result to the database, and marks the job complete. This avoids long HTTP request timeouts for heavy processing. The user can poll or be notified when the response is ready. Celery is a common choice; as one developer notes, “having Celery/Redis up and running… \[allows dumping] assistant tasks on a queue” to avoid blocking requests.

## Persona Configuration

Each AI persona (journalist or character) is defined by a profile plus user-customizable traits. The profile includes the persona’s name, background, and typical writing style. In the **settings panel**, the user can tweak variables like *tone* (formal, neutral, casual, etc.), *current interests* (topics to emphasize), or *opinions* (political slant, bias). These settings are stored (in the `personas` table or user-specific overrides) and incorporated into the system prompt. For example, if the user sets “tone = witty” and “focus = climate change,” the prompt might say:

> *“You are **\[Name]**, responding with wit. Discuss the issue of climate change from your unique perspective.”*

System messages are explicitly intended to steer the AI’s behavior and persona. By adjusting the prompt and using system roles, the app ensures the AI “plays” the correct character. A well-designed system prompt can greatly affect the response style. For instance, we might prepend a system message like: *“Answer in first person as \[Journalist Name] reporting live for \[Outlet], using a \[tone] tone and current knowledge.”*

## Real-Time vs. Asynchronous Modes

* **Real-Time Mode:** The backend processes the chat synchronously. When the user submits a report, the backend immediately calls the AI API with the prompt and waits for the reply. The AI’s answer is returned to the frontend and displayed at once. This mode is suitable for short queries or when immediate feedback is needed (e.g. small reports).
* **Queued (Asynchronous) Mode:** The backend responds immediately by acknowledging receipt (without waiting for the AI). It enqueues the job into a task queue. A separate worker then processes the job by invoking the AI model, generating the answer, and saving it. The user can check later (via the dashboard or WebSocket) to retrieve the answer. Using a queue (Celery with Redis, for example) “dump\[s] these assistant tasks on a queue” and allows long-running or heavy tasks to finish outside the HTTP request cycle. This avoids request timeouts and scales better for batch processing or complex jobs.
* **Implementation:** You can implement this by having two API paths (or a mode flag). In `/api/chat`, check the mode flag: if **real-time**, call the AI and return the result in one response; if **queued**, create a chat record with status “pending” and trigger a Celery task (e.g. `generate_response.delay(chat_id)`). The Celery worker retrieves the chat info (user ID, persona, prompt) from the DB, calls the LLM, saves the AI reply into the messages table, and updates the chat status. The frontend can poll `/api/chat/{chat_id}` or use WebSocket notifications to fetch the completed answer.

## Data Persistence and Dashboard

All user interactions and chats are stored so users can review them later. Key data models include:

* **Users:** Store user credentials and profiles.
* **Personas:** Store persona definitions and any user-specific customizations.
* **Conversations/Chats:** Each chat session has an ID, user\_id, persona\_id, mode (real-time/queued), timestamps, etc.
* **Messages:** Each message (report or AI response) is logged with fields (message\_id, chat\_id, sender, content, timestamp).
* **Jobs/Tasks:** (for queued mode) track background job IDs and status (pending/complete).

On the user’s **Dashboard**, they can see a list of past chats (with dates and personas) and click to view the full conversation transcript. The backend provides endpoints like `GET /api/chats` and `GET /api/chats/{id}` to retrieve this info. Many chatbot designs simply append each new message as a database record per message, but one may also store entire conversation objects (e.g. JSON blobs). The IBM reference design notes that a document-oriented DB can store “conversation interactions in a single document” for simplicity.

This diagram shows the main data flows. In real-time mode (top), the front end calls the backend, which calls the LLM and writes to the DB. In async mode (bottom), the backend enqueues a task that a worker later processes (calling the LLM and updating the DB).

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

1. **Project Setup:** Initialize a Python project and version control (e.g. Git). Create a virtual environment and install necessary packages (e.g. `flask` or `fastapi`, `openai` or other model client, `celery`, database ORM like `SQLAlchemy` or `Tortoise`, etc.). Set up a basic server and test that a “Hello World” endpoint and static file hosting work.

2. **Database Schema:** Choose a database (PostgreSQL is common). Define schemas/models for Users, Personas, Chats, Messages, and (if needed) Jobs. For example:

   * `users(id, username, password_hash, ...)`
   * `personas(id, name, description, tone, interests, opinions)`
   * `chats(id, user_id, persona_id, mode, created_at, status)`
   * `messages(id, chat_id, sender, text, timestamp)`
   * `jobs(id, chat_id, status)`
     Use an ORM to simplify CRUD operations. Include indexes on foreign keys (user\_id, chat\_id) for query efficiency. A document store could be used where each `chat` document contains an array of messages, but a relational design (one row per message) is also fine.

3. **User Authentication:** Implement user registration and login. You can use Flask-Login (Flask) or OAuth/JWT (FastAPI) to manage sessions or tokens. Ensure passwords are hashed. Protect API endpoints so that users can only access their own data. Once logged in, the frontend stores a token or cookie for authenticated requests.

4. **Persona Management:** Pre-populate the `personas` table with some real journalist profiles and fictional characters. Each persona has a description and default style. In the frontend, create a panel (or page) that lets the user select a persona and adjust settings (tone, focus, etc.). When the user updates settings, send them to the backend (e.g. `POST /api/persona/{id}/config`) and save them. These settings should influence subsequent prompts. You might store them either in the `personas` table (if global) or in a separate user-specific table if each user can have private overrides.

5. **Backend API Endpoints:** Create RESTful endpoints such as:

   * `POST /api/chat`: Submit a new report. Body includes `{ persona_id, text, mode }`. The backend creates a new chat record (with status “pending” if queued) and either processes immediately or enqueues a task (see steps 7–8).
   * `GET /api/chat/{id}`: Fetch a completed chat (all messages) by chat\_id (only if it belongs to the current user).
   * `GET /api/chats`: List all chats for the user.
   * `PUT /api/persona/{id}/config`: Update persona settings (tone, interests) for the user.
   * `GET /api/personas`: List available personas.
   * Authentication-protected routes as needed (e.g. with JWT middleware).

6. **Integrate AI Model (LLM):** In the backend, write a function to call the AI API. For example, using OpenAI’s ChatCompletion API: send messages like `[{"role": "system", "content": persona_prompt}, {"role": "user", "content": report_text}]`. Construct `persona_prompt` using the persona’s profile and the user’s selected settings: e.g. *“You are \[Name], respond in a \[tone] tone, focusing on \[interests] and reflecting \[opinions].”*. Call the API (e.g. `openai.ChatCompletion.create(model="gpt-4", messages=msgs)`) and capture the assistant’s reply. Handle errors and rate limits as needed. You may choose any model (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, etc.) based on cost/quality. For testing without a real API, you could stub this with a mock response.

7. **Real-Time Mode Logic:** In the `POST /api/chat` handler, check if `mode == "real-time"`. If so, **synchronously** call the AI function with the prompt. Once you get the response, save the user’s message and the AI’s reply into `messages`, mark the chat as complete, and return the response JSON to the client. The frontend then displays it immediately. This is straightforward but depends on fast responses (suitable for small texts).

8. **Queued Mode Logic:** If `mode == "queued"`, do **not** call the AI directly. Instead, create the chat record with status “pending” and enqueue a Celery task. For example:

   ```python
   chat = Chat(user_id=current_user, persona_id=pid, mode="queued", status="pending")
   db.session.add(chat); db.session.commit()
   generate_response.delay(chat.id, user_text, persona_id, user_settings)
   ```

   Return a quick HTTP response (e.g. `{ job: chat.id }`) to the frontend. Meanwhile, the Celery worker (in a separate process) executes `generate_response(chat_id, text, ...)`. In that task, retrieve the chat, call the LLM API with the same prompting logic, then save the AI’s reply in `messages` and update `chat.status = "done"`. The user’s frontend can periodically poll `GET /api/chat/{chat_id}` until it sees the response and status updated.

9. **Frontend Chat UI:** Build the chat interface. A simple HTML page with:

   * A dropdown or selector for Personas.
   * Text input area for the report.
   * A “tone/interests” panel if desired.
   * A submit button.
     When the user submits, send `POST /api/chat` with the data. In real-time mode, display the response as it arrives. In queued mode, show a “Processing...” message and poll for results. Use DOM manipulation (vanilla JS) to append messages to the chat log on the page.

10. **Persona Settings UI:** On the frontend, allow the user to click “Settings” for a persona. Provide form fields (sliders or text boxes) for tone, current interests, etc. When changed, send these to the backend (e.g. via `PUT /api/persona/{id}/config`). The backend should store these, and the next time the user chats with that persona, include these preferences in the system prompt.

11. **User Dashboard:** Create a dashboard page where the user sees past chats. For each chat, display summary info (date, persona name, mode). Each entry links to a detailed view showing the conversation. Implement endpoints (`GET /api/chats`) to retrieve the list, and reuse `GET /api/chat/{id}` for details. Ensure only the owning user can see their chats.

12. **Authentication Flows:** Secure your API. For example, with Flask you might use Flask-Login sessions or JWT tokens. On each API request, verify the user and attach `current_user`. Reject unauthorized access. On the frontend, manage sessions/cookies or store the JWT and include it in headers.

13. **Testing and Iteration:** Test with sample reports. Verify the persona emulation by tweaking system prompts and model settings (temperature, max\_tokens). Adjust the prompt format until the output matches the journalist’s style. Monitor usage and handle edge cases (long inputs, errors).

14. **Deployment:** Use Docker to containerize the components (backend, frontend, worker, database). You can adapt the Docker Compose pattern from the example architecture. For production, use an Nginx container to serve the frontend static files and reverse-proxy to the API. Scale the worker processes as needed. Host on a cloud platform (AWS, Azure, etc.), ensuring you securely manage API keys and use HTTPS.

15. **Future Video Integration (Phase 2):** Once the text-based system works, you can add video output. One approach: take the AI’s text response and feed it into a text-to-video API or avatar generator. For example, OpenAI’s **Sora** model can create short videos from textual scenes. You might first do text-to-speech (TTS) for the persona’s voice, then synchronize a face animation or avatar. Or use services like Synthesia.ai for talking avatars. This is a complex extension but can be architected as another service downstream of the chat response. For now, structure your code so that after the text is generated, a “video engine” step could be added (e.g. `generate_video(response_text)`).

By following these steps and using the components above, you can build a robust AI-persona chat application. Citations in this plan (e.g. \[51], \[31], \[35], \[46], \[41]) provide concrete examples of chatbot architectures, system-prompt usage, conversation persistence, async processing, and future video technology to guide your implementation. These references show that separating services (AI, DB, UI) improves scalability, system prompts effectively shape AI persona, and using task queues (Celery) is a proven strategy for background LLM tasks.

**Sources:** Design patterns for chat architectures; best practices for guiding LLM personas via system messages; persisting chatbot conversations in a database; using Celery for asynchronous LLM tasks; and text-to-video generation models. Each component and step above builds on these insights to ensure a complete, end-to-end solution.

# Building a RAG-based Pitch Evaluation System

To build a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system for evaluating news pitches, we combine AI modules for summarization, reasoning, retrieval, and generation.  First, collect a large **knowledge base** of relevant content (news archives, articles, interview/video transcripts).  For example, use APIs or scrapers to download news articles and extract YouTube interview transcripts (via the YouTube API or tools like `youtube_transcript_api`).  Preprocess all source text by removing boilerplate, normalizing formatting (lowercasing, removing ads), and splitting long texts into chunks (e.g. 500–1000 word passages).  This is crucial because LLMs have token limits.  As one guide notes, “LLMs cannot process an unlimited number of tokens in a single query…we break data down into smaller and more structured pieces so the model can efficiently retrieve information”.

* **Sources**: News archives, journalist articles, video interview transcripts, web articles, research reports, etc.
* **Preprocessing**: Clean text, remove HTML/boilerplate, segment long documents into paragraphs or chunks.
* **Knowledge Base**: Convert each chunk into a semantic vector and store in a vector database (e.g. Pinecone, FAISS, Weaviate).  Use an embedding model (like OpenAI’s embeddings) to turn text into high-dimensional vectors.  For instance, transform “text is converted into vector embeddings (the numerical representation that captures the meaning)” and “the embeddings are stored in a vector database for quick retrieval”.  Index all vectors in the database to enable fast similarity search.

With data ingested, we proceed through a **RAG pipeline** as follows:

* **(1) Summarize the Pitch with Persona Lens:**  Take the user’s pitch (plain text) and produce a concise summary highlighting its key ideas *from the perspective of the target persona*.  Use an LLM (e.g. GPT) with a prompt that embeds persona details (role prompting).  For example: *“You are an editor interested in investigative stories. Summarize this pitch, focusing on aspects you care about.”*  This is akin to query-focused summarization: the “query” is the persona’s interests.  Query-focused summarization allows specifying items of interest when summarizing.  Thus the model will emphasize the elements the persona values.  Using role prompting (assigning a persona to the LLM) helps guide tone and focus.

* **(2) Define Evaluation Criteria & Questions:**  Establish rubric parameters to score the pitch.  Common criteria might include *relevance, originality, clarity, evidence quality, editorial fit, impact*, etc., tailored by persona.  For each criterion, define guiding questions (e.g. *“Does the pitch present a novel angle?”*, *“Are sources credible?”*, *“Is the writing clear?”*).  This step can leverage AI by prompting an LLM to generate or refine evaluation questions.  Optionally use chain-of-thought prompting so the model lists reasoning steps or sub-questions.  The reasoning module effectively “grades” the pitch on each parameter, producing scores.

* **(3) Retrieve Relevant Context (RAG Augmentation):** Use the cleaned knowledge base to augment the analysis.  Convert the (possibly summarized) pitch into an embedding and perform a semantic search against the vector database.  Retrieve top-matching documents or passages related to the pitch content (e.g. background news stories, expert quotes, statistics).  This retrieval enriches the context for evaluation and response.  In RAG terms, we augment the query with retrieved information.  For example, if the pitch is about climate policy, the system may fetch recent articles or transcripts on that topic.  As explained, vector databases enable “semantic search… based on meaning” rather than exact keywords.  The retrieved snippets then provide factual grounding for the AI’s feedback.

* **(4) Generate Response with LLM (Persona Tone):** Combine the pitch summary, reasoning notes, and retrieved evidence into a prompt for a large language model.  Instruct the LLM to write a **formal scorecard or assessment**. Use role prompting to enforce the persona’s voice and tone.  For example, include a prompt like *“As \[Persona Name], provide a structured evaluation of this pitch.”*  You can also format a template (few-shot examples) showing how the scorecard should look (e.g. headings like “Clarity,” “Impact,” each with a score and comment).  According to best practices, assigning a persona (role) to the LLM “guides the style, tone, and focus of responses”.  This helps the output match the desired editorial voice.  The LLM then synthesizes an answer that is **contextually relevant** (using both the pitch and retrieved info) and **grounded in facts** from the knowledge base.

* **(5) Format the Final Output:** Structure the LLM’s content into the specified output format (a scorecard or commentary).  For each parameter, include a numeric score and a brief rationale.  You might map score ranges to qualitative labels (e.g. 9–10 = “excellent,” 5–6 = “fair”).  Ensure the overall style is formal and matches examples of news commentary or investigative notes, as needed.  The response generator module applies these formatting rules and may apply editorial edits.  The result is a concise report with separate sections (scores, comments, recommendations) that can be readily turned into qualitative feedback later.

Throughout this pipeline, AI components play key roles: **summarization models**, **retrieval/embedding models**, and **generative LLMs**.  For instance, the ingestion step uses an embedding model to create vectors.  The RAG process itself is four steps of ingest–query–retrieve–generate.  By indexing the knowledge base with embeddings and using semantic search, the system grounds its answers in actual news content, reducing hallucinations.  Finally, persona-driven prompting ensures the tone and focus align with user expectations.

**Step-by-Step Implementation Guide:**

1. **Collect and Preprocess Data:** Crawl news archives and transcripts. Clean and split text into chunks.
2. **Build the Vector Knowledge Base:** Embed all chunks and store in a vector DB for similarity search.
3. **Summarize Pitch (Persona-aware):** Prompt an LLM to summarize the user’s pitch with persona context (query-focused summary).
4. **Define Evaluation Rubric:** List scoring criteria and craft guiding questions (can iterate with LLM).
5. **Retrieve Relevant Information:** Embed the pitch, retrieve top-k related documents from the KB.
6. **Generate the Draft Scorecard:** Prompt an LLM with the summary, retrieved snippets, and rubric to produce a structured response. Include persona role for tone.
7. **Format and Refine:** Organize the LLM output into the final scorecard format, mapping scores to feedback phrases. Optionally apply post-editing or another LLM pass for polish.
8. **Iterate and Validate:** Test the system with example pitches. Adjust prompts, rubric, and retrieval settings based on quality. Ensure citations or references from the KB are included if needed.

By following these steps and leveraging RAG techniques, you create a backend that intelligently analyzes pitches. The AI-backed pipeline ensures the response is informed by external facts (via retrieval) while maintaining the persona’s perspective and producing a clear, structured evaluation.

**Sources:** Standard RAG workflows and vector indexing methods; Microsoft documentation on query-focused summarization; and prompt engineering advice on persona/role prompting. These outline best practices for constructing and using a knowledge base to augment LLM outputs, and for guiding tone via personas.
