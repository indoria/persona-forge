## üõ†Ô∏è Product Development Process

### Phase 1: Ideation & Planning (Weeks 1‚Äì2)

* Define core features:

  * Persona creation (name, traits, style)
  * Persona memory + behavior config
  * Chat interface (text, maybe voice)
* Choose foundational tech:

  * Base model (OpenAI API, open source?)
  * Frameworks (Next.js, LangChain, Pinecone, etc.)
* Define key success metrics (DAUs, retention, accuracy, latency)

### Phase 2: Prototype (Weeks 3‚Äì6)

* **Goal:** Functional prototype with limited persona customization and chat
* Core features:

  * Frontend chat UI
  * Backend API to handle prompts
  * Prompt engineering for persona behavior
  * Simple persona profile schema
* Use OpenAI APIs for rapid dev
* Tools: Vercel, Supabase/Firebase, Postgres, OpenAI SDK

### Phase 3: MVP Development (Weeks 7‚Äì12)

* **Core Features:**

  * Persona builder UI (sliders, text fields)
  * Saved personas (linked to account)
  * Memory store (per persona)
  * Chat UX: reply history, markdown support, feedback buttons
  * Basic moderation (prevent unsafe output)
* Team expands (add 1‚Äì2 more engineers or freelancers)

### Phase 4: Private Beta Launch (Weeks 13‚Äì16)

* Release to 20‚Äì50 trusted testers
* Collect feedback (what works, what breaks, what‚Äôs missing)
* Track key metrics: engagement, bugs, retention
* Add analytics & error reporting (PostHog, Sentry)

### Phase 5: Public Launch (Weeks 17‚Äì20)

* Final UI polish, onboarding flow
* Payments (Stripe)
* Rate limiting, abuse prevention
* Launch on Product Hunt, Reddit, Twitter, etc.
