Here's an even more comprehensive table, incorporating scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, and Gensim, while maintaining the details for NLTK, spaCy, and Hugging Face Transformers.

I've structured it to highlight the primary focus and common use cases for each, as they often play different roles in an NLP project.

6.  **Clarification for "Not used":** Replaced "Not used" with specific alternatives or explanations (e.g., scikit-learn doesn't do "text embedding" directly but relies on vectorizers or external embeddings).

This table provides a much more detailed and practical guide for selecting the appropriate NLP tool based on specific project requirements and preferences.


Here's an expanded and categorized list of functionalities provided by various NLP frameworks and libraries, going beyond the basics to cover a broader spectrum of tasks and applications:

### Expanded List of NLP Functionalities

This list covers the diverse range of tasks and capabilities that modern Natural Language Processing tools and frameworks offer, from foundational text processing to advanced language understanding and generation.

#### I. Foundational Text Processing & Linguistics

These are the initial steps for preparing and understanding text.

1.  **Tokenization (Word & Sentence):**
    * **Word Tokenization:** Breaking down text into individual words or sub-word units (tokens).
    * **Sentence Tokenization:** Dividing a text into its constituent sentences.
2.  **Stemming/Lemmatization:**
    * **Stemming:** Reducing words to their root or base form by removing suffixes (e.g., "running" -> "run"). Often a heuristic process.
    * **Lemmatization:** Reducing words to their canonical dictionary form (lemma), considering context and vocabulary (e.g., "better" -> "good"). More linguistically informed than stemming.
3.  **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:**
    * Assigning grammatical categories (e.g., noun, verb, adjective, adverb) to each word in a text based on its definition and context.
4.  **Stop Word Removal:**
    * Eliminating common words (e.g., "the," "is," "and") that often carry little semantic meaning and can be noise in text analysis.
5.  **Punctuation Handling:**
    * Removing, normalizing, or preserving punctuation marks as needed for specific tasks.
6.  **Text Normalization & Cleaning:**
    * Standardizing text by converting to lowercase, handling contractions, removing special characters, emojis, or HTML tags.
7.  **Spelling Correction / Grammar Checking:**
    * Identifying and correcting typos, grammatical errors, and suggesting stylistic improvements.

#### II. Information Extraction & Understanding

Focuses on extracting structured information and deeper meaning from unstructured text.

8.  **Named Entity Recognition (NER):**
    * Identifying and classifying named entities in text into predefined categories like persons, organizations, locations, dates, monetary values, etc.
9.  **Entity Linking (NEL / Entity Disambiguation):**
    * Linking identified named entities to unique identifiers in a knowledge base (e.g., linking "Apple" to Apple Inc. in Wikidata).
10. **Coreference Resolution:**
    * Identifying when different words or phrases (e.g., pronouns, full names) refer to the same real-world entity within a text.
11. **Relation Extraction:**
    * Identifying semantic relationships between named entities in text (e.g., "X works for Y," "A is located in B").
12. **Event Extraction:**
    * Identifying and categorizing specific events mentioned in text, along with their participants, time, and location.
13. **Keyword/Keyphrase Extraction:**
    * Automatically identifying the most important words or phrases that summarize the main content of a document.
14. **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA):**
    * Analyzing sentiment at a more granular level, focusing on the sentiment expressed towards specific aspects or features of an entity (e.g., "The phone's *battery life* is great, but the *camera* is disappointing").
15. **Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD):**
    * Determining the correct meaning of a word when it has multiple possible senses, based on its context (e.g., "bank" as a financial institution vs. river bank).

#### III. Text Representation & Modeling

Methods for converting text into numerical formats suitable for machine learning.

16. **Text Embedding / Word & Document Vectors:**
    * Representing words, phrases, or entire documents as dense numerical vectors in a continuous vector space, capturing semantic relationships. Includes traditional (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText) and contextual (BERT, ELMo) embeddings.
17. **Topic Modeling:**
    * Unsupervised learning technique to discover abstract "topics" that occur in a collection of documents.
18. **Text Classification:**
    * Categorizing text into predefined classes or labels (e.g., spam detection, news categorization, intent recognition).
19. **Text Clustering:**
    * Grouping similar text documents together without predefined categories.

#### IV. Language Generation & Advanced Applications

Focuses on creating human-like text and complex interactive systems.

20. **Text Summarization:**
    * **Extractive Summarization:** Selecting key sentences or phrases directly from the original text to form a summary.
    * **Abstractive Summarization:** Generating new sentences to convey the main ideas, potentially paraphrasing or condensing information, rather than just extracting.
21. **Text Generation (Conditional & Unconditional):**
    * Creating coherent and contextually relevant new text, either from scratch (unconditional) or based on a given prompt, topic, or style (conditional). Used for chatbots, content creation, creative writing.
22. **Machine Translation:**
    * Automatically translating text or speech from one natural language to another while preserving meaning.
23. **Question Answering (QA):**
    * Developing systems that can understand a question posed in natural language and provide an accurate answer, often by extracting it from a given text (extractive QA) or generating a new answer (generative QA).
24. **Dialogue Systems / Chatbots:**
    * Building conversational AI agents that can interact with users in a natural language, understand intent, manage turns, and provide appropriate responses.
25. **Language Modeling:**
    * Predicting the next word or sequence of words given a preceding context, fundamental for many generative tasks.
26. **Speech Recognition (ASR - Automatic Speech Recognition):**
    * Converting spoken language into written text.
27. **Text-to-Speech (TTS):**
    * Converting written text into synthetic spoken language.
28. **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):**
    * A subfield of NLP focused on enabling computers to truly comprehend the meaning and intent behind human language.
29. **Natural Language Generation (NLG):**
    * A subfield of NLP focused on generating human-like text from structured data or internal representations.
30. **Multimodal NLP:**
    * Integrating NLP with other modalities like images or audio (e.g., image captioning, visual question answering).
31. **Style Transfer:**
    * Modifying the style of a text while preserving its content (e.g., making a formal text informal, or vice-versa).
32. **Fact-Checking & Misinformation Detection:**
    * Automatically verifying factual claims in text and identifying potential fake news or misleading content.
33. **Bias Detection & Mitigation:**
    * Identifying and reducing biases in text data or AI models, especially in sensitive applications.
34. **Model Fine-tuning:**
    * Adapting a pre-trained large language model (LLM) to a specific downstream task or domain with a smaller, task-specific dataset.
35. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):**
    * Combining the power of LLMs with information retrieval systems to provide more accurate, up-to-date, and contextually grounded responses by fetching relevant data from external knowledge bases.

This comprehensive list highlights the depth and breadth of NLP, from basic linguistic analysis to complex, intelligent applications.
